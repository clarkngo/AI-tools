    "whatIs": "Napkin is a unique tool for thought that helps you collect ideas and, more importantly, discover the connections between them. Instead of organizing notes in folders, Napkin uses AI to create a dynamic, networked view of your thoughts, surfacing related ideas automatically. It's designed for inspiration and \"serendipitous discovery.\"",
    "useCases": [
        "<strong>Creative Brainstorming:</strong> A place to dump all your shower thoughts and let the AI help you see the patterns.",
        "<strong>Research and Learning:</strong> Collect notes from articles, books, and lectures, and let Napkin show you how different concepts are related.",
        "<strong>Writing:</strong> Use it as an \"idea farm.\" When you're ready to write, you can explore the network of thoughts you've built on a topic.",
        "<strong>Personal Development:</strong> Track personal insights, quotes, and reflections, and see how your thinking evolves over time."
    ],
    "gettingStarted": [
        "<strong>Capture an Idea:</strong> The core action in Napkin is adding a thought. Keep it brief and focused on a single concept. You can type it directly into the app or use integrations to send notes from other apps.",
        "<strong>Let the AI Work:</strong> As soon as you enter a note, Napkin's AI analyzes it. It doesn't just store it; it immediately looks for connections to your existing notes based on semantic meaning, not just keywords.",
        "<strong>Explore Connections:</strong> When you look at a note, Napkin will show you a \"stack\" of related notes underneath it. This is the magic of the app. You can browse these connections to see how your ideas relate in surprising ways.",
        "<strong>Look for \"Sparks of Insight\":</strong> The app will sometimes proactively show you connections you might have missed, helping you form new, more complex ideas from your simpler building blocks.",
        "<strong>Don't Organize:</strong> Resist the urge to create folders or complex tag systems. The entire philosophy of Napkin is to let the structure emerge naturally through the AI-driven connections. Just focus on collecting your thoughts."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "<strong>Keep Notes Atomic:</strong> Each note should be about one thing. This makes it easier for the AI to find precise connections. Instead of a long note about a book, create several small notes about the individual ideas within it.",
        "<strong>Use Your Own Words:</strong> Write thoughts in the way you naturally think them. The semantic AI is good at understanding meaning, so you don't need to use formal or keyword-heavy language.",
        "<strong>Review Daily:</strong> Spend a few minutes each day looking at the connections Napkin has surfaced. This is a great way to spark new ideas or see your work from a different perspective.",
        "<strong>Trust the Process:</strong> It can feel strange not having a folder structure. Trust that by focusing on collection, the important ideas and connections will surface when you need them."
