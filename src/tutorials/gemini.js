    "whatIs": "Gemini is a family of multimodal AI models from Google, designed to understand and process different types of information seamlessly. It can work with text, code, images, and in its most advanced form, audio and video. This makes it incredibly flexible and powerful.",
    "useCases": [
        "<strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Interpret charts, graphs, and tables from images or documents.",
        "<strong>Creative Inspiration:</strong> Generate ideas, stories, or marketing copy based on visual prompts.",
        "<strong>Learning & Problem Solving:</strong> Take a picture of a math problem or a diagram and ask for a step-by-step explanation.",
        "<strong>Coding:</strong> Describe a UI you want to build, and Gemini can generate the code for it."
    ],
    "gettingStarted": [
        "<strong>Access Gemini:</strong> You can access Gemini through various Google products, including the dedicated Gemini web app (gemini.google.com).",
        "<strong>Understand the Interface:</strong> The interface is centered around a prompt box. You can type text, but you can also upload images or other files.",
        "<strong>Try a Multimodal Prompt:</strong> This is where Gemini shines. Upload an image and ask a question about it. For example, upload a picture of your lunch and ask, <code>\"Estimate the number of calories in this meal and suggest a good workout to burn it off.\"</code>",
        "<strong>Analyze Data:</strong> Upload an image of a chart or graph. Ask Gemini to analyze it for you: <code>\"What is the main trend shown in this bar chart? Summarize the key takeaways.\"</code>",

        "<strong>Be Descriptive:</strong> When you upload an image, describe what you want the AI to focus on. <code>\"In the attached image of a circuit board, identify the capacitors and explain their function.\"</code>",
        "<strong>Iterate on Prompts:</strong> Just like other models, conversation is key. Refine your questions based on the AI's responses to get more accurate and detailed information.",
        "<strong>Check for Extensions:</strong> In some Google products, Gemini can connect to extensions like Google Maps, Flights, and your Workspace (Gmail, Docs). Use these to perform real-world tasks."
