    "whatIs": "A Chemical Equation AI Solver is a specialized calculator for chemistry. It uses AI to automatically balance unbalanced chemical equations, ensuring that the law of conservation of mass (the same number of atoms of each element on both sides of the reaction) is satisfied. It's a fast and accurate tool for students and professionals.",
    "useCases": [
        "<strong>Chemistry Students:</strong> Quickly check homework, study for exams, and understand the process of balancing equations.",
        "<strong>Chemists and Researchers:</strong> Save time by automating the balancing of complex reactions encountered in their work.",
        "<strong>Educators:</strong> Generate examples and solutions for teaching materials and chemistry problems."
    ],
    "gettingStarted": [
        "<strong>Find the Input Field:</strong> The tool's website will have a clear input box for your equation.",
        "<strong>Enter the Unbalanced Equation:</strong> Type in the reactants and products using standard chemical notation. Use a plus (<code>+</code>) between compounds and an arrow (<code>-></code>) to separate reactants from products.",
        "<strong>Click \"Balance\":</strong> Press the \"Balance\" or \"Solve\" button. The AI will process the equation.",
        "<strong>Review the Solution:</strong> The tool will return the balanced equation, complete with the correct stoichiometric coefficients in front of each compound.",
        "<strong>View the Explanation:</strong> Good solvers will also provide a step-by-step explanation of how they arrived at the solution, which is invaluable for learning the balancing process yourself."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "<strong>Use Correct Notation:</strong> The AI relies on correct chemical formulas. Ensure you use proper capitalization (e.g., <code>Co</code> for Cobalt, <code>CO</code> for Carbon Monoxide) and formatting for polyatomic ions (e.g., <code>Fe(NO3)3</code>).",
        "<strong>Check for Common Mistakes:</strong> If the solver gives an error, double-check your input for typos or incorrect chemical formulas.",
        "<strong>Use it for Learning, Not Just Cheating:</strong> The real value of these tools is in the step-by-step explanations. Use them to understand *why* the coefficients are what they are, so you can learn to balance equations yourself."
