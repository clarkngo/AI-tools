            <h2>What is Napkin?</h2>
            <p>Napkin is a unique tool for thought that helps you collect ideas and, more importantly, discover the connections between them. Instead of organizing notes in folders, Napkin uses AI to create a dynamic, networked view of your thoughts, surfacing related ideas automatically. It's designed for inspiration and "serendipitous discovery."</p>

            <h3>Common Use Cases</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Creative Brainstorming:</strong> A place to dump all your shower thoughts and let the AI help you see the patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Research and Learning:</strong> Collect notes from articles, books, and lectures, and let Napkin show you how different concepts are related.</li>
                <li><strong>Writing:</strong> Use it as an "idea farm." When you're ready to write, you can explore the network of thoughts you've built on a topic.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Development:</strong> Track personal insights, quotes, and reflections, and see how your thinking evolves over time.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="highlight">"Your ideas in conversation with each other."</p>

            <h3>Getting Started: A Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Capture an Idea:</strong> The core action in Napkin is adding a thought. Keep it brief and focused on a single concept. You can type it directly into the app or use integrations to send notes from other apps.</li>
                <li><strong>Let the AI Work:</strong> As soon as you enter a note, Napkin's AI analyzes it. It doesn't just store it; it immediately looks for connections to your existing notes based on semantic meaning, not just keywords.</li>
                <li><strong>Explore Connections:</strong> When you look at a note, Napkin will show you a "stack" of related notes underneath it. This is the magic of the app. You can browse these connections to see how your ideas relate in surprising ways.</li>
                <li><strong>Look for "Sparks of Insight":</strong> The app will sometimes proactively show you connections you might have missed, helping you form new, more complex ideas from your simpler building blocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't Organize:</strong> Resist the urge to create folders or complex tag systems. The entire philosophy of Napkin is to let the structure emerge naturally through the AI-driven connections. Just focus on collecting your thoughts.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Tips for Effective Use</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keep Notes Atomic:</strong> Each note should be about one thing. This makes it easier for the AI to find precise connections. Instead of a long note about a book, create several small notes about the individual ideas within it.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Your Own Words:</strong> Write thoughts in the way you naturally think them. The semantic AI is good at understanding meaning, so you don't need to use formal or keyword-heavy language.</li>
                <li><strong>Review Daily:</strong> Spend a few minutes each day looking at the connections Napkin has surfaced. This is a great way to spark new ideas or see your work from a different perspective.</li>
                <li><strong>Trust the Process:</strong> It can feel strange not having a folder structure. Trust that by focusing on collection, the important ideas and connections will surface when you need them.</li>
