        "<strong>Go to the Website:</strong> Navigate to the Suno website and sign in.",
        "<strong>Describe Your Song:</strong> In the main creation box, type a description of the song you want to make. Be descriptive! For example: <code>\"A soulful acoustic pop song about a rainy day in the city.\"</code>",
        "<strong>(Optional) Use Custom Mode:</strong> Toggle to \"Custom Mode\" to provide your own lyrics and have more control over the song's style and title.",

    "tips": [
        "<strong>Use Genre Tags:</strong> Be specific about the musical genre. Use tags like <code>[acoustic pop]</code>, <code>[90s hip-hop]</code>, <code>[cinematic orchestral]</code> in your prompts to guide the AI.",
        "<strong>Describe the Vibe:</strong> Use emotional and descriptive words for the mood, such as \"somber,\" \"energetic,\" \"epic,\" or \"lo-fi chill.\"",
        "<strong>Iterate on Lyrics:</strong> In Custom Mode, if the AI doesn't sing the lyrics quite right, try rephrasing them or adding annotations like <code>[verse]</code> or <code>[chorus]</code> to guide the structure.",
        "<strong>Experiment with Random Styles:</strong> If you're feeling stuck, just put in some lyrics and let Suno choose a random style. The results can be surprisingly good and lead to new ideas."
