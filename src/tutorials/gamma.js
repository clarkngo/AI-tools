    "whatIs": "Gamma is an AI tool that acts as an alternative to traditional presentation software like PowerPoint or Google Slides. It allows you to generate beautiful and engaging presentations, documents, and webpages from a simple text prompt. It focuses on automating the design process so you can focus on the content.",
    "useCases": [
        "<strong>Business Pitches:</strong> Quickly create a professional-looking pitch deck for investors or clients.",
        "<strong>School Projects:</strong> Generate a report or presentation for a class in a fraction of the time.",
        "<strong>Marketing Materials:</strong> Create simple one-page websites, brochures, or informational documents.",
        "<strong>Meeting Agendas and Summaries:</strong> Paste in your notes and have Gamma format them into a clean, readable document to share with your team."
    ],
    "gettingStarted": [
        "<strong>Sign Up and Choose a Template:</strong> After signing up for Gamma, you'll start a new project. You can choose to generate from a prompt or start with a template.",
        "<strong>Write a Prompt:</strong> This is the core of Gamma. Give the AI a detailed instruction. Don't just say \"a presentation about space.\" Instead, provide an outline. For example: <code>\"A 10-slide presentation on the future of space exploration. Include slides on Mars colonization, asteroid mining, the role of private companies like SpaceX, and future challenges.\"</code>",
        "<strong>Let the AI Generate:</strong> Gamma will take your prompt and create a full presentation with text, layouts, and stock images. It will create a title slide, an agenda, and individual content slides.",
        "<strong>Edit and Refine:</strong> The initial generation is a starting point. You can easily edit the text on any card, change images, and use the AI editor to rewrite sections or change the tone.",
        "<strong>Customize the Design:</strong> While Gamma automates design, you still have control. You can change the theme, colors, and fonts of the entire presentation with a single click, and it will intelligently reformat everything."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "<strong>Provide a Good Outline:</strong> The quality of your initial prompt determines the quality of the generated presentation. The more structure you provide (e.g., \"Slide 1: Title, Slide 2: Introduction...\"), the better the result.",
        "<strong>Use the \"AI Edit\" Feature:</strong> If you don't like a certain section, you don't have to rewrite it yourself. Highlight the text and use Gamma's built-in AI tools to shorten, lengthen, or rephrase it.",
        "<strong>Think in \"Cards\":</strong> Gamma uses a \"card\"-based system instead of rigid slides. This allows for more flexible and web-native layouts. You can easily add new cards or change their layout.",
        "<strong>Embed Rich Content:</strong> You can embed videos, GIFs, and interactive web content directly into your Gamma presentations, making them more dynamic than traditional slides."
