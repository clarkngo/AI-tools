            <h2>What is Consensus?</h2>
            <p>Consensus is an AI-powered search engine designed specifically for scientific research. Instead of searching through blogs and news articles, it searches a database of over 200 million peer-reviewed papers. It uses AI to extract the key findings related to your question and presents them in a clear, digestible format, making it easy to find evidence-based answers.</p>

            <h3>Common Use Cases</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Academic Research:</strong> Quickly find out what the scientific literature says about a specific topic, hypothesis, or relationship between variables.</li>
                <li><strong>Fact-Checking:</strong> Verify health, science, or social science claims by going directly to the source research.</li>
                <li><strong>Content Creation:</strong> Find credible, citable evidence to support claims in articles, reports, or presentations.</li>
                <li><strong>Decision Making:</strong> Make evidence-based decisions by quickly gathering relevant scientific findings on a subject.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Getting Started: A Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Go to the Website:</strong> Navigate to the `consensus.app` website.</li>
                <li><strong>Ask a Research Question:</strong> The search bar is optimized for research questions. Instead of keywords, ask a question as if you were asking a researcher. For example: <code>"Does intermittent fasting improve metabolic health?"</code></li>
                <li><strong>Review the Results:</strong> Consensus will show you a list of "cards," each containing a direct quote or finding from a research paper that addresses your question. It often categorizes them (e.g., "Yes," "No," "Possibly").</li>
                <li><strong>Use the Synthesizer:</strong> At the top, you'll often see a "Summary" or "Synthesize" feature. This provides an AI-generated summary of the findings from the top-cited papers, giving you a quick overview of the scientific consensus.</li>
                <li><strong>Explore the Papers:</strong> Each card links directly to the source paper, often with an open-access PDF if available, so you can dive deeper into the research.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Tips for Effective Use</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ask Questions, Not Keywords:</strong> You will get much better results by phrasing your query as a question (e.g., "What is the effect of..." or "Is there a link between...").</li>
                <li><strong>Use the Filters:</strong> You can filter results by study type (e.g., Randomized Controlled Trial, Meta-Analysis), journal quality, and other criteria to find the highest-quality evidence.</li>
                <li><strong>Look for Meta-Analyses:</strong> For many topics, a meta-analysis or systematic review provides the strongest level of evidence. Use the filters to find these first.</li>
                <li><strong>Check the Context:</strong> The extracted claims are powerful, but always click through to the paper to understand the full context of the study before drawing strong conclusions.</li>
