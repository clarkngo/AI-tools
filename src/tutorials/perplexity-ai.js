    "whatIs": "Perplexity AI is an AI-powered \"answer engine\" that combines a large language model with a search engine. Instead of just giving you a list of links, it directly answers your questions and provides a list of sources and citations for its claims, making it a powerful tool for research.",
    "useCases": [
        "<strong>Academic Research:</strong> Quickly find papers, get summaries of complex topics, and gather citations for a bibliography.",
        "<strong>Fact-Checking:</strong> Verify claims you see online by asking Perplexity for a sourced answer.",
        "<strong>Learning Something New:</strong> Get a quick, reliable overview of any topic, from historical events to scientific theories.",
        "<strong>Professional Research:</strong> Summarize market trends, analyze competitor reports, or understand new regulations, all with cited sources."
    ],
    "gettingStarted": [
        "<strong>Go to the Website:</strong> Navigate to the Perplexity AI website. The interface is clean and search-focused.",
        "<strong>Ask a Question:</strong> Type a question into the search bar just as you would on Google, but you can be more conversational. For example: <code>\"What are the pros and cons of nuclear energy compared to solar power?\"</code>",
        "<strong>Review the Answer and Sources:</strong> Perplexity will write a comprehensive answer, often with headings and bullet points. Crucially, you will see numbered citations next to the claims. Below the answer, you'll find a list of the sources it used.",
        "<strong>Ask Follow-up Questions:</strong> The initial answer is just the start. You can ask clarifying questions in the same thread, and Perplexity will maintain the context of the conversation.",
        "<strong>Use the \"Focus\" Feature:</strong> For more targeted searches, you can use the \"Focus\" setting to limit the search to specific domains like Academic papers, YouTube, Reddit, or WolframAlpha for computational knowledge."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "<strong>Always Check the Sources:</strong> The biggest advantage of Perplexity is its transparency. Click on the source links to verify the information and get more context.",
        "<strong>Use \"Copilot\" for Deeper Research:</strong> The pro version includes a feature called Copilot, which asks you clarifying questions to better understand your intent and conduct a more thorough search.",
        "<strong>Attach Files:</strong> You can upload documents (like PDFs or text files) and ask questions about them, turning Perplexity into a research assistant for your own material.",
        "<strong>Think of it as a Research Partner:</strong> Use it to get a foundational understanding of a topic, complete with sources, before diving deeper into the primary materials."
