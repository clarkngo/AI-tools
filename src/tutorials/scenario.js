    "whatIs": "Scenario is an AI platform specifically designed for generating high-quality, consistent game assets. It allows users to train their own AI models on their unique art style, ensuring that all generated assets fit seamlessly into their game world.",
    "useCases": [
        "<strong>Consistent Character Sprites:</strong> Generate multiple poses and expressions for a character in the same style.",
        "<strong>Game Props & Items:</strong> Quickly create a wide variety of in-game items like weapons, potions, and furniture.",
        "<strong>Isometric Assets:</strong> Produce assets for isometric or 2.5D games.",
        "<strong>Marketing & Icons:</strong> Create icons and marketing materials that match the game's art style."
    ],
    "gettingStarted": [
        "<strong>Access the Tool:</strong> Sign up or log in on the Scenario website.",
        "<strong>Create a Model:</strong> Upload your existing art to train a custom AI model on your style.",
        "<strong>Generate Images:</strong> Once the model is trained, use text prompts to generate new assets in your style.",
        "<strong>Refine and Edit:</strong> Use the built-in tools to make adjustments to the generated images.",
        "<strong>Export Assets:</strong> Export the finished assets for use in your game engine."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "<strong>Be Specific About the Asset:</strong> Clearly define the asset you need (e.g., <code>\"side-scrolling sprite of a goblin warrior, holding a rusty sword\"</code>).",
        "<strong>Reference Your Model:</strong> Ensure you are using your custom-trained model for generation.",
        "<strong>Define the View:</strong> Specify the perspective (e.g., <code>\"top-down view,\"</code> <code>\"isometric\"</code>).",
        "<strong>Iterate on Prompts:</strong> Start with a simple prompt and add more detail to refine the output."
