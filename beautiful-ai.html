            <h2>What is Beautiful.ai?</h2>
            <p>Beautiful.ai is a presentation maker that uses artificial intelligence to automate the rules of good design. Instead of giving you total freedom to move things around (and mess them up), it provides smart, pre-designed slide templates that automatically adapt as you add content. The goal is to make every presentation look like it was professionally designed.</p>

            <h3>Common Use Cases</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sales and Marketing Pitches:</strong> Quickly create polished, on-brand presentations that look professional and clean.</li>
                <li><strong>Start-up Investor Decks:</strong> Impress investors with a visually stunning deck that looks like it was made by a design agency.</li>
                <li><strong>Internal Reports:</strong> Present data and project updates in a clear, easy-to-understand format.</li>
                <li><strong>Educational Lectures:</strong> Create engaging lecture slides without spending hours on formatting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Getting Started: A Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Start a New Presentation:</strong> After signing up, create a new presentation. You will be prompted to choose a theme (colors, fonts, etc.) that will be applied consistently.</li>
                <li><strong>Add a "Smart Slide":</strong> This is the core of Beautiful.ai. Instead of a blank slide, you choose a template based on what you want to show: a timeline, a bar chart, a Venn diagram, a team photo grid, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Add Your Content:</strong> Click on the placeholder text and images to add your own content. As you type or add items, you will notice the <span class="highlight">AI automatically adjusts the layout</span>. If you add a 5th bullet point, it might resize the text. If you add another photo, it will re-center the grid.</li>
                <li><strong>Use the Slider Controls:</strong> Each smart slide has simple controls, often sliders, to make adjustments. For example, on a chart slide, you can drag a slider to change the value of a bar, and the chart will animate and re-render instantly.</li>
                <li><strong>Let the AI Handle Design:</strong> Trust the constraints. The tool prevents you from making poor design choices (like using too many fonts or misaligning elements). This "opinionated" approach is its main feature.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Tips for Effective Use</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Choose the Right Smart Slide:</strong> Think about the *type* of information you want to present first, then find the slide template that matches it. Don't try to force a template to do something it wasn't designed for.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on the Narrative:</strong> Since the design is largely automated, you can spend more of your time thinking about the story you are telling and the clarity of your content.</li>
                <li><strong>Use the "DesignerBot":</strong> If you have a slide with a lot of content, you can use the AI "DesignerBot" to automatically suggest different ways to visualize that same information, converting it to a new smart slide format.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaborate with Your Team:</strong> Beautiful.ai has collaboration features that allow your team to work on a presentation together, ensuring everyone stays within the same design guidelines.</li>
