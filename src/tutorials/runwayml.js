    "whatIs": "RunwayML is a comprehensive online platform for artists and creators that provides a suite of powerful AI \"magic tools\" focused on video and image manipulation. It started as a tool for artists to use machine learning models and has evolved into a full-featured, web-based content creation suite, most famous for its video generation capabilities.",
    "useCases": [
        "<strong>Text-to-Video:</strong> Generate short video clips from a simple text description (e.g., \"a drone shot flying through a futuristic city\").",
        "<strong>Video Editing:</strong> Automatically remove backgrounds from videos, paint out unwanted objects, or track the motion of an object in a scene.",
        "<strong>Image Generation:</strong> Create and expand images using text prompts, similar to other image generators.",
        "<strong>AI Training:</strong> For advanced users, Runway allows you to train your own custom AI models on your own data."
    ],
    "gettingStarted": [
        "<strong>Create an Account:</strong> Sign up on the RunwayML website. You will get a certain number of free credits to start experimenting.",
        "<strong>Explore the AI Magic Tools:</strong> The dashboard presents a wide array of tools. A good one to start with is \"Text to Video (Gen-2).\"",
        "<strong>Generate Your First Video:</strong> In the Gen-2 tool, type a prompt describing the video clip you want to create. Be descriptive about the subject, action, and style. Click \"Generate.\"",
        "<strong>Edit an Existing Video:</strong> Upload one of your own video clips. Try using the \"Remove Background\" tool to instantly create a green-screen effect, or the \"Inpainting\" tool to brush over and remove an object from the scene.",
        "<strong>Export Your Creation:</strong> Once you are happy with the result, you can export the video or image file."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "<strong>Start with a Clear Goal:</strong> Know what you want to achieve. Are you generating a new clip, or editing an existing one? Runway has a specific tool for almost every task.",
        "<strong>Keep Video Prompts Simple:</strong> Text-to-video is still a new technology. Prompts with a clear subject and a simple action (e.g., \"a man walking on a beach\") work better than complex scenes with multiple actions.",
        "<strong>Use Image Prompts for Gen-2:</strong> You can upload a starting image along with your text prompt to have more control over the composition and style of the generated video.",
        "<strong>Chain Tools Together:</strong> A powerful workflow is to generate a clip with Gen-2, then take that clip into the editor to remove the background, then use the motion tracking tool on the result."
