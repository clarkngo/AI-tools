            <h2>What is Mapify?</h2>
            <p>Mapify is a conceptual AI tool that specializes in generating visual maps from text descriptions. It's designed for users who need to create a map of a place—whether real or fictional—but don't have the skills or time to use complex Geographic Information System (GIS) or illustration software. It turns your words into a geographical representation.</p>

            <h3>Common Use Cases</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dungeon Masters and TTRPG Players:</strong> Quickly create world maps, regional maps, or city layouts for a Dungeons & Dragons campaign.</li>
                <li><strong>Authors and World-Builders:</strong> Visualize the fantasy or sci-fi worlds they are creating for their stories to maintain consistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Educators and Students:</strong> Generate simple historical maps or visualize geographical concepts for a lesson.</li>
                <li><strong>Event Planners:</strong> Create a stylized map of a festival ground, campus, or event venue.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Getting Started: A Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Access the Tool:</strong> Navigate to the Mapify web interface. You'll typically find a large text box for your description and a canvas where the map will be generated.</li>
                <li><strong>Describe Your World:</strong> This is the creative part. Write a detailed description of the map you want to create. Be as specific as possible about geographical features and their relationships. For example: <code>"A fantasy kingdom called Eldoria. In the center is the capital city, Silverwood, surrounded by a dense forest. A large river, the Crystal River, flows from the northern mountains, past the city, and down to the southern sea. A small port town, Seawatch, is on the coast."</code></li>
                <li><strong>Choose a Style:</strong> Most map generators allow you to select a visual style, such as "fantasy," "modern," "satellite," or "hand-drawn." Select the one that best fits your needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Generate the Map:</strong> Click the generate button. The AI will interpret your text and create a map based on your description.</li>
                <li><strong>Refine and Edit:</strong> The first draft may not be perfect. Good tools will allow you to edit the map, either by changing your text prompt and regenerating, or by using simple tools to move, add, or delete elements directly on the map.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Tips for Effective Use</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use Relational Language:</strong> The AI understands relationships between objects. Use phrases like "north of," "next to," "surrounded by," and "along the coast of" to guide the layout.</li>
                <li><strong>Start Broad, Then Get Specific:</strong> In your first prompt, describe the major features (continents, oceans, mountains). In later prompts, you can add more detail, like cities, roads, and points of interest.</li>
                <li><strong>Layer Your Descriptions:</strong> Don't try to describe everything in one massive paragraph. You might describe the geography first, then the political boundaries, then the locations of cities.</li>
                <li><strong>Use it for Inspiration:</strong> If you're not sure what you want, give it a vague prompt like <code>"a mysterious island with a volcano"</code> and see what the AI comes up with. You can then refine its creation.</li>
