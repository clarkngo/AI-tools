            <h2>What is Grok?</h2>
            <p>Grok is a conversational AI developed by xAI. Its defining feature is its ability to access real-time information from the X (formerly Twitter) platform, allowing it to provide up-to-the-minute answers. It's also designed to have a rebellious and witty personality, often answering with more humor and sarcasm than other AIs.</p>

            <h3>Common Use Cases</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-Time News Summarization:</strong> Get a quick overview of breaking news and public sentiment.</li>
                <li><strong>Market and Trend Analysis:</strong> Understand what consumers and communities are saying about products, brands, or topics.</li>
                <li><strong>Content Discovery:</strong> Find interesting and relevant posts, articles, and discussions on X.</li>
                <li><strong>Creative Writing:</strong> Use its witty personality to help write humorous or engaging content.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Getting Started: A Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Access Grok:</strong> Grok is primarily available to X Premium subscribers. You can access it through the X website or mobile app.</li>
                <li><strong>Choose Your Mode:</strong> Grok often provides two modes: a standard "Fun Mode" and a more straightforward "Regular Mode." You can switch between them to control the tone of the responses.</li>
                <li><strong>Ask About Current Events:</strong> Test its real-time capabilities. Ask a question about a very recent news story or a trending topic on X. For example: <code>"What are people on X saying about the latest NASA announcement?"</code></li>
                <li><strong>Engage in Complex Queries:</strong> Ask questions that require synthesizing recent information. <code>"Summarize the main arguments in the tech community over the past 24 hours regarding the new AI regulations."</code></li>
                <li><strong>Explore its Personality:</strong> Don't be afraid to ask spicy or humorous questions to see its unique character in action.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Tips for Effective Use</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use it for Timeliness:</strong> Grok's biggest advantage is its connection to live data. It's the best tool for understanding what is happening *right now*.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't Take it Too Seriously:</strong> Especially in "Fun Mode," Grok is designed to be edgy. Its answers may be provocative or humorous, so keep the context of its personality in mind.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Reference for Critical Information:</strong> While its real-time access is powerful, it's still an AI. For critical decisions, it's always wise to verify information from multiple sources.</li>
                <li><strong>Use it for Brainstorming:</strong> Its unique personality can be a great creative partner, offering suggestions you might not get from a more neutral AI.</li>
