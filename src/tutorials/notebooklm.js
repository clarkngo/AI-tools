    "whatIs": "NotebookLM is a research and writing assistant from Google that is grounded in your own content. Unlike traditional AIs that pull from the entire internet, NotebookLM uses the documents you provide—like PDFs, Google Docs, or copied text—as its exclusive source of information. This makes it an expert in *your* material.",
    "useCases": [
        "<strong>Students:</strong> Create study guides, summarize textbook chapters, and find key information from lecture notes.",
        "<strong>Researchers:</strong> Analyze and synthesize multiple research papers, identify themes, and generate literature reviews.",
        "<strong>Business Professionals:</strong> Summarize meeting transcripts, analyze reports, and quickly get up to speed on long document threads.",
        "<strong>Writers:</strong> Keep world-building notes, character sheets, and plot outlines in one place and ask questions to ensure consistency."
    ],
    "gettingStarted": [
        "<strong>Create a New Notebook:</strong> Go to the NotebookLM website and start a new \"notebook,\" which is like a dedicated workspace for a project.",
        "<strong>Add Your Sources:</strong> This is the most important step. In the \"Sources\" section, add your content. You can upload files from your computer or link directly to Google Docs. You can add multiple sources to a single notebook.",
        "<strong>Ask Questions:</strong> Once your sources are loaded, you can start asking questions in the chat interface. For example, if you uploaded class notes, you could ask: <code>\"What are the key themes from the lecture on October 5th?\"</code>",
        "<strong>Generate Content:</strong> Ask the AI to generate new content based on your sources. For example: <code>\"Generate a 5-point summary of all the provided research papers\"</code> or <code>\"Create a study guide based on my uploaded lecture notes.\"</code>",
        "<strong>Use Inline Citations:</strong> When NotebookLM answers, it will often show citations that link directly back to the specific passages in your source documents, so you can instantly verify its claims."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "<strong>Curate Your Sources:</strong> The quality of the output depends entirely on the quality of your input. Use clean, well-structured documents for the best results.",
        "<strong>Create Different Notebooks:</strong> Keep projects separate. Have one notebook for your history class, another for a work project, and a third for your creative writing.",
        "<strong>Use it as a Thinking Partner:</strong> Ask open-ended questions to find connections between documents. <code>\"What is the relationship between the ideas in Source A and the data in Source B?\"</code>",
        "<strong>Save Useful Responses:</strong> You can \"pin\" or save helpful AI responses, summaries, or generated ideas to your notebook for later reference."
