    "whatIs": "Histography AI is a specialized tool for automatically creating visual timelines and historical infographics. It takes a set of events, dates, and descriptions, and uses AI to intelligently lay them out on a chronological map. This helps to visualize the flow of history, project plans, or any sequence of events in a clear and compelling way.",
    "useCases": [
        "<strong>History Students and Teachers:</strong> Create visual aids for understanding historical periods, battles, or the life of a historical figure.",
        "<strong>Project Managers:</strong> Build a project timeline with key milestones, deadlines, and dependencies to share with stakeholders.",
        "<strong>Legal Professionals:</strong> Lay out a sequence of events for a case in a clear, chronological order.",
        "<strong>Content Creators:</strong> Generate infographics for blog posts or videos that explain the history of a topic."
    ],
    "gettingStarted": [
        "<strong>Input Your Data:</strong> Most timeline tools will allow you to input data in a structured format, like a CSV file, or through a simple interface with fields for \"Date,\" \"Event Title,\" and \"Description.\"",
        "<strong>Provide a Text Prompt:</strong> Alternatively, you can describe the timeline you want. For example: <code>\"Create a timeline of the major events of the Space Race between the USA and USSR, starting from the launch of Sputnik in 1957 to the Apollo moon landing in 1969.\"</code>",
        "<strong>Choose a Layout and Style:</strong> Select how you want the timeline to be displayed. Common options include a horizontal line, a vertical line, or more complex 2D layouts. You can also choose visual themes to match your presentation.",
        "<strong>Generate the Timeline:</strong> The AI will process your data or prompt and generate the visual timeline. It will automatically position events to avoid overlap and create a readable flow.",
        "<strong>Customize and Annotate:</strong> Review the generated timeline. You should be able to click on events to add more detail, insert images, or change colors to highlight key milestones."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "<strong>Ensure Consistent Date Formats:</strong> If you are uploading data, make sure your dates are in a consistent format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY). This is the most critical element for the AI to build the timeline correctly.",
        "<strong>Keep Descriptions Concise:</strong> The timeline is a visual summary. Keep the event descriptions brief. You can always link out to more detailed documents if needed.",
        "<strong>Use Categories or Tags:</strong> If your tool supports it, categorize your events (e.g., \"Political,\" \"Technological,\" \"Cultural\"). This can allow you to color-code the timeline and make it even easier to read.",
        "<strong>Don't Overcrowd It:</strong> A good timeline tells a story. Focus on the most important events that support your narrative. If you have too many data points, consider creating multiple timelines or a higher-level summary."
