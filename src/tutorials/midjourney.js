    "whatIs": "Midjourney is an independent research lab that produces a proprietary AI program that creates images from textual descriptions, known as \"prompts.\" It is renowned for generating images with a high degree of artistic flair, realism, and detail. It is primarily accessed through the Discord chat app and a web interface.",
    "useCases": [
        "<strong>Art & Illustration:</strong> Create stunning, original artwork, character designs, and illustrations in a wide variety of styles.",
        "<strong>Conceptual Design:</strong> Quickly visualize concepts for products, architecture, logos, or marketing campaigns.",
        "<strong>Inspiration:</strong> Generate creative ideas and visual starting points for any project.",
        "<strong>Content Creation:</strong> Create unique images for blog posts, social media, presentations, or videos."
    ],
    "gettingStarted": [
        "<strong>Join the Discord:</strong> To start, you need a Discord account. Join the official Midjourney Discord server.",
        "<strong>Find a Newbie Channel:</strong> Inside the server, find one of the channels labeled <code>#newbies</code> or <code>#general</code>.",
        "<strong>Use the /imagine Command:</strong> In the message box, type <code>/imagine</code> and a prompt will appear. Type your image description inside the prompt box. For example: <code>/imagine prompt: a futuristic city at sunset, cinematic lighting, hyper-detailed</code>",
        "<strong>Generate and Upscale:</strong> Midjourney will generate a grid of four images. Below the grid, you'll see buttons labeled U1-U4 (Upscale) and V1-V4 (Vary). Use \"U\" to get a larger, more detailed version of an image, and \"V\" to create four new variations of a selected image.",
        "<strong>Save Your Image:</strong> Once you have an upscaled image you like, you can click on it and save it directly."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "<strong>Be Descriptive:</strong> The more detail you add, the better. Include the subject, setting, style (e.g., \"in the style of Van Gogh\"), lighting, and mood.",
        "<strong>Use Parameters:</strong> Midjourney has powerful parameters. Add <code>--ar 16:9</code> to the end of your prompt for a widescreen aspect ratio, or <code>--style raw</code> for a more photographic look.",
        "<strong>Remix and Vary:</strong> The \"Vary\" buttons are powerful for exploring ideas. You can also use the \"Remix\" feature to change parts of your prompt on a variation.",
        "<strong>Study Other Prompts:</strong> Look at what other people are creating in the public channels. It's a great way to learn new prompting techniques."
