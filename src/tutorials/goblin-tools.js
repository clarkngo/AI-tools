    "whatIs": "Goblin Tools is not a single AI, but a collection of small, simple, and highly practical AI-powered tools. It was created specifically to help neurodivergent individuals with common executive functioning challenges, but its usefulness extends to everyone. The tools are designed to be straightforward and solve one problem at a time.",
    "useCases": [
        "<strong>Overcoming Procrastination:</strong> Breaking a daunting task like \"clean the kitchen\" into tiny steps makes it much easier to start.",
        "<strong>Professional Communication:</strong> Ensuring your emails and messages to colleagues or clients have the right tone.",
        "<strong>Understanding Social Cues:</strong> Getting a second opinion on the tone of a text message or email that you find confusing.",
        "<strong>Project Planning:</strong> Turning a chaotic brain dump of ideas into an actionable and organized project plan."
    ],
    "gettingStarted": [
        "<strong>Magic To-Do:</strong> This is the core tool. You type in a task, like \"do laundry,\" and the AI breaks it down into a checklist of smaller, more manageable steps (e.g., \"gather dirty clothes,\" \"separate colors,\" \"put a load in the washer,\" etc.). You can adjust the \"spiciness\" level to get more or fewer steps.",
        "<strong>The Formalizer:</strong> This tool helps you change the tone of your writing. You can paste in a casual or emotional text and have the AI rewrite it to be more formal, more professional, more polite, or less passive-aggressive.",
        "The Judge: If you have trouble interpreting the tone of a message you received, you can paste it into the Judge. It will analyze the text and tell you what emotion or tone it detects.",
        "The Estimator: This tool attempts to estimate how long a task might take. While not perfectly accurate, it can be a helpful guide for planning your time when you feel overwhelmed.",
        "The Compiler: This is for \"brain dumps.\" You can write down all your scattered thoughts about a project, and the Compiler will organize them into a structured list of tasks."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "<strong>Use the Right Tool for the Job:</strong> The beauty of Goblin Tools is its simplicity. Don't try to make one tool do everything. If you need to break down a task, use Magic To-Do. If you need to rephrase an email, use the Formalizer.",
        "<strong>Adjust the \"Spiciness\":</strong> For Magic To-Do, the spiciness level (represented by chili peppers) is a key feature. If you feel very overwhelmed, use a high spiciness level to get very small, detailed steps. If you just need a general outline, use a lower level.",
        "<strong>Itâ€™s a Guide, Not a Rulebook:</strong> Use the outputs as a starting point. You can edit, delete, or add to any checklist the AI generates. The goal is to help you get started, not to provide a rigid plan."
