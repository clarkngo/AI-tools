    "whatIs": "Consensus is an AI-powered search engine designed specifically for scientific research. Instead of searching through blogs and news articles, it searches a database of over 200 million peer-reviewed papers. It uses AI to extract the key findings related to your question and presents them in a clear, digestible format, making it easy to find evidence-based answers.",
    "useCases": [
        "<strong>Academic Research:</strong> Quickly find out what the scientific literature says about a specific topic, hypothesis, or relationship between variables.",
        "<strong>Fact-Checking:</strong> Verify health, science, or social science claims by going directly to the source research.",
        "<strong>Content Creation:</strong> Find credible, citable evidence to support claims in articles, reports, or presentations.",
        "<strong>Decision Making:</strong> Make evidence-based decisions by quickly gathering relevant scientific findings on a subject."
    ],
    "gettingStarted": [
        "<strong>Go to the Website:</strong> Navigate to the <code>consensus.app</code> website.",
        "<strong>Ask a Research Question:</strong> The search bar is optimized for research questions. Instead of keywords, ask a question as if you were asking a researcher. For example: <code>\"Does intermittent fasting improve metabolic health?\"</code>",
        "<strong>Review the Results:</strong> Consensus will show you a list of \"cards,\" each containing a direct quote or finding from a research paper that addresses your question. It often categorizes them (e.g., \"Yes,\" \"No,\" \"Possibly\").",
        "<strong>Use the Synthesizer:</strong> At the top, you'll often see a \"Summary\" or \"Synthesize\" feature. This provides an AI-generated summary of the findings from the top-cited papers, giving you a quick overview of the scientific consensus.",
        "<strong>Explore the Papers:</strong> Each card links directly to the source paper, often with an open-access PDF if available, so you can dive deeper into the research."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "<strong>Ask Questions, Not Keywords:</strong> You will get much better results by phrasing your query as a question (e.g., \"What is the effect of...\" or \"Is there a link between...\").",
        "<strong>Use the Filters:</strong> You can filter results by study type (e.g., Randomized Controlled Trial, Meta-Analysis), journal quality, and other criteria to find the highest-quality evidence.",
        "<strong>Look for Meta-Analyses:</strong> For many topics, a meta-analysis or systematic review provides the strongest level of evidence. Use the filters to find these first.",
        "<strong>Check the Context:</strong> The extracted claims are powerful, but always click through to the paper to understand the full context of the study before drawing strong conclusions."
