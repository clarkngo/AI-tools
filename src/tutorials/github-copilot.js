    "whatIs": "GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that provides autocomplete-style suggestions as you code. It can suggest individual lines or entire functions, and it integrates directly into your code editor (like VS Code, JetBrains, etc.). It's powered by a model trained on billions of lines of open-source code.",
    "useCases": [
        "<strong>Speeding Up Development:</strong> Autocomplete boilerplate code, repetitive patterns, and common functions instantly.",
        "<strong>Learning a New Language:</strong> See idiomatic ways to write code in a language you're unfamiliar with.",
        "<strong>Writing Tests:</strong> Generate unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests based on your open files and code context.",
        "<strong>Solving Problems:</strong> Describe a problem in a comment, and Copilot can suggest the code to solve it."
    ],
    "gettingStarted": [
        "<strong>Get a Subscription:</strong> Copilot requires a subscription through your GitHub account (it's free for verified students and maintainers of popular open-source projects).",
        "<strong>Install the Extension:</strong> Find and install the GitHub Copilot extension in your preferred code editor (e.g., the VS Code Marketplace).",
        "<strong>Authorize the Extension:</strong> After installation, you'll be prompted to sign in to GitHub to authorize the extension.",
        "<strong>Start Coding:</strong> As you start typing code or writing comments, Copilot will automatically provide suggestions in grayed-out text.",
        "<strong>Accept or Reject:</strong> To accept a suggestion, press the <code>Tab</code> key. To reject it, simply keep typing. You can also cycle through alternative suggestions (often with <code>Alt/Option + ]</code> or <code>[</code>)."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "<strong>Write Good Comments:</strong> Copilot uses your comments to generate code. Write a clear, descriptive comment of what you want a function to do, and it will often write the whole function for you.",
        "<strong>Provide Context:</strong> Copilot works best when it has context. Having related files open in your editor can help it make more relevant suggestions.",
        "<strong>Use Copilot Chat:</strong> Many versions now include a chat interface where you can ask coding questions, ask it to explain code, or request specific refactors.",
        "<strong>Always Review Suggestions:</strong> Copilot is a powerful tool, but it's not perfect. Always review the code it generates to ensure it is correct, secure, and fits your project's standards."
