    "whatIs": "Explain Paper is an AI-powered tool designed to make academic and scientific papers easier to understand. It allows you to upload a research paper, highlight confusing text, and get a simple explanation, helping to break down the barriers of dense, technical jargon.",
    "useCases": [
        "<strong>Students:</strong> Quickly get up to speed on required reading for a course, especially in technical fields.",
        "<strong>Researchers Entering a New Field:</strong> Understand the foundational papers in a new area of study without getting bogged down by unfamiliar terminology.",
        "<strong>Journalists and Science Communicators:</strong> Accurately report on new scientific findings by ensuring they fully understand the source material.",
        "<strong>Curious Minds:</strong> Explore interesting scientific topics without needing a Ph.D. to understand the papers."
    ],
    "gettingStarted": [
        "<strong>Upload a Paper:</strong> Go to the Explain Paper website. The first step is to upload a PDF of the research paper you want to read.",
        "<strong>Highlight Confusing Text:</strong> Once the paper is loaded, read through it as you normally would. When you encounter a sentence, paragraph, or even a mathematical equation that you don't understand, simply highlight it with your mouse.",
        "<strong>Get an Explanation:</strong> After highlighting the text, an AI-powered panel will appear. It will provide a simplified explanation of the selected text, defining jargon and clarifying complex ideas.",
        "<strong>Ask Follow-up Questions:</strong> The explanation is interactive. If the simplified version is still unclear, you can ask follow-up questions in a chat-like interface to dive deeper into the concept.",
        "<strong>Change the Difficulty:</strong> You can often specify the level of the explanation, for example, asking for it to be explained to a 5th grader, an undergraduate, or a fellow researcher from a different field."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "<strong>Don't Highlight Everything:</strong> Use the tool strategically. Try to understand the paper on your own first, and use Explain Paper for the specific sections that are blocking your comprehension.",
        "<strong>Focus on Methodology and Results:</strong> These are often the densest parts of a paper. Use the tool to clarify the statistical methods used or the implications of the results.",
        "<strong>Combine with Other Tools:</strong> Use Explain Paper to understand the text, and a tool like Perplexity AI to find related papers or definitions of key concepts.",
        "<strong>Check the Original Context:</strong> The AI's explanation is a great starting point, but always refer back to the original text to ensure the nuance of the author's meaning is not lost."
